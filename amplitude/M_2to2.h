! Introduce your 2->2 matrix element or integrand here.
! For illustrative purposes, we have set the identity function
! as integrand.
! 
! M = 1.d0
! 
! The previous definition of the integrand M has been commented out
! in order to introduce a well-known non-trivial example in the massless regime:
! 
! Sigma(Pi^+ Pi^0 -> Pi^+ Pi^0)

M = -s*z1/2*Fp**2
